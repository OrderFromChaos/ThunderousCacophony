### -------------=--=-=-=-========= Project Goal =========-=-=-=--=-------------

The goal of this project is to form a sonification library for weather data. Since weather data varies significantly from time to time, it makes sense to map a frequency modulation to the absolute temperature. As such, the presentation example corresponding with this code is built for frequency modulation. Included as well is a general mapping function and a method to modify volume/timbre based on data. We have included a data feeding program plus example weather data from a few different locations.

### ------------=--=-=-=-========= Dependencies =========-=-=-=--=------------

numpy (data pulls/text file reads)

math (helper to applyMapping() and converter for frequency -> MIDI)

midiutil (writing MIDI files)

pygame (playing MIDI files)

matplotlib.pyplot (visualization)

pyaudio (playing sounds from audiolazy

### -----------=--=-=-=-========= Interior Structure =========-=-=-=--=-----------

Data is fed from the text files through WDataPull.py using numpy and some reorganization methods. Unusable data is cut out.

Once this data is formatted correctly, it is fed into Sonification.py. Sonification takes advantage of three primary functions to turn the data into sound:

    applyMapping(data, ranges, equ)

This function takes data from an array with some range, say [1,2,3,4,5] with range 1-5 and maps it into a new range, say 1-3. The final output array would be [1, 1.5 ,2 ,2.5 ,3]. This is especially useful because temperature data is all over the place. Using this, we can map our temperature ranges (which could be negative or in some range like 50-80) to frequency ranges. The frequency ranges that MIDI accepts (according to [this webpage](http://glassarmonica.com/science/frequency_midi.php)) are 27.5-4186 Hz, so this is our new mapping.

Equ is a flag which tells the function whether or not to apply an equation to the data before mapping. This equation is hard-coded in, but can be changed before runtime. The function can be arbitrarily complex.

    toMultiMIDI(data, bpm, filename, n_tracks)

This function accepts data in the format [[1,2,3,4],...]. Each data point in the inner array is put on a different track, and each inner array corresponds to a beat. The beat speed can be controlled by the bpm argument.

n_tracks should later be rewritten to be automatically inferred from len(data[0]) in the future.

    playMIDI(filename)

This is a simple pygame player which plays the MIDI file just made by toMultiMIDI().


### -----------=--=-=-=-========= Program Testing =========-=-=-=--=-----------

Try using the samples() function in Sonification.py, especially samples(2) and samples(4).
